      <p>Hey, I'm Andrew Kirsfelds. Most people just call me Andy ðŸ‘‹</p>
      <p>I'm a software developer based in Manchester (the one where <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/jan/03/like-a-beautiful-painting-image-of-new-years-mayhem-in-manchester-goes-viral">that photo</a> was taken). This this is my little corner of the world wide web.</p>

      <h2>Projects</h2>
      <p>I'm currently working on a small Flask API to enhance some of the word games I built while learning React.</p>
      <p>Other things I've built include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>A <a href="https://nigel-plebes.netlify.app/">word guessing game</a>, based on the NYT's Spelling Bee, using React.</li>
        <li>An app that allows family members to record, upload and playback bedtime stories for young children in the family when they are unable to read them in person. This was a group project using Svelte and TypeScript for the frontend . The back end is written in Python and Flask.</li>
        <li>A <a href="https://akflds-nc-news.netlify.app/">social news app</a> with a responsive, React-based front-end and a <a href="http://akflds-news-api.herokuapp.com/">RESTful, JSON-based back end</a> built with Express.</li>
        <li>A <a href="https://github.com/akflds/potato-cakes">scrappy hackathon effort</a> to find the best potato cakes in Australia. Written in Python and visualised with Tableau.</li>
      </ul>
