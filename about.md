Hey! I'm Andy ðŸ‘‹

I'm currently working through the [Northcoders](https://northcoders.com) coding bootcamp where I hope to gain the skills to start a new career in software development.

Before this I spent over a decade working in the higher education sector, primarily as a Learning Experience Designer and Learning Technologist.

Outside of work I like riding bikes, eating pizza and picking up the skills (and power tools!) needed to fix up a Victorian terrace.
